# Top marks
This program takes as input a csv file containing First Name, Second Name and Score
for people. 
The csv must have a header with these column names. 
It outputs the top scorers in alphabetical order to STDOUT.
An example csv file can be found in the repo.  

## How to run
`python3 top_marks.py {path to csv file}`
